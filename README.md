# About
This project is an Android App that communicates with [a back-end server](https://github.com/SamGarciaIGF/OnePieceServer) to display different One Piece characters. It's roughly based on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-modern-android-app-with-rest-api-and-ktor-server).

It uses the following stack:

 - **Jetpack Compose**: native Android UI toolkit.
 - **Room**: Android local database.
 - **Dagger Hilt**: dependency injection.
 - **Retrofit**: HTTP client for Android and Java.
 - **Accompanist**: extensions for Jetpack Compose.
